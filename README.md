Here's a README file for your project on GitHub:

React Weather App
This project is a simple weather application built with React and Vite that fetches data from the OpenWeather API to display the current weather information.

Project Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js
Vite
An API Key from OpenWeather
Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-weather-app.git
cd react-weather-app
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up your OpenWeather API Key:

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project.
Add the following line, replacing YOUR_API_KEY with your OpenWeather API key:
plaintext
Copy code
VITE_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
By default, the server will run on localhost:5713.

Project Structure
